				<h2>Conclusion</h2>
				<p>Gandhiji was a simple person who used to mix ideals in his personality.</p>
				<p>He wanted to see India a decveloped country, free from malpractices, diseases, poverty, discrimination and hunger.</p>
				<p>For his dream to come true we have to leave our greed and continue to work for our country taking it as a duty of a ciizen and a return to our motherland.</p>

				<h2>12. Partnerships for the Goals</h2>
				<p>No movement in India gained succes without participation for the people. Similarly participation of the citizens of the country is necessary for these Sustainable Development Goals to be achived by India.</p>
				<p>One should not think that he had bought the government giving his vote.</p>
				<p>No one should hesitate in cleaning the country or thinking for the welfare of the country.</p>

				<h2>11. Peace, Justice and strong Institutions</h2>
				<p>Gandhiji was a firm believer of non-violence and wanted to have its followers keep faith in peace and Truth</p>
				<p>On this principle of Ghandhiji, India installed a democratic setup where peace shall be maintained by the authorities and Justice provided ro the innoscent and victim.</p>
				<p>Still there is a need to make them more powerful to implement their procedures more efficiently.</p>

				<h2>10. Responsible Consumption and Production</h2>
				<p>During the first World War crops failed in many parts of India, many farmers committed sucide and a major part from what was left in crops was used to feed the army.</p>
				<p>Gandhiji wanted the people of the country to produce for their need and not consume in greed.</p>
				<p>Now-a-days this need to be executed to control the greed of rich industrialists.</p>

				<h2>9. Sustainable Cities and Communities</h2>
				<p>The era of late colonial period saw Industrial Revolution. Machines used to do mass production, workers lose their jobs</p>
				<p>Gandhiji was in favour of production by masses. He wanted the people to make and wear Swadeshi</p>
				<p><b>'Swadeshi'</b> led to the strengthening of Indian Industries which now contribute to India's economy.</p>

				<h2>8. Reduced Inequalities</h2>
				<p>The time before colonial period and during colonial period saw a massive discrimination on the basis of caste.</p>
				<p>Gandhiji was against this discrimination and never called dalits, instead gave them the title <b>'Harijan'</b>.</p>
				<p>In the present time discrimination on the basis of caste, religion, gender or race is strictly prohibited by the constitution of India and is a punishable offence.</p>

				<h2>7. Affordable and Clean Energy</h2>
				<p>The people in those dayus uses to cook food by burning firewood.</p>
				<p>To make India a developed country Gandhiji wanted the people of India to aquire modern methods which were much cleaner and easy to use than the old ones which pollute the environment.</p>
				<p>Today a scheme called <b>'Ujjwala Yojana'</b> has replaced several firewood with CNG gas cylinders contributing to environmental safety.</p>

				<h2>6. Clean Water and Sanitation</h2>
				<p>The Indian people during colonial period were not well-educated, they even used to go in open areas for excretion</p>
				<p>Gandhiji always emphasized on <b>'Swachch  Bharat'</b> and himself cleaned the toilet to glorify the work of sweeper.</p>
				<p>Now-a-days government is trying to provide good sanitation facilities to each section of society in every area of the country.</p>

				<h2>5. Gender Equality</h2>
				<p>Indian culture didn't give much freedom and power to women. The society was reluctant to let women work outside the house</p>
				<p>Gandhiji encouraged women to take part in mass struggles and contribute to India's freedom struggle</p>
				<p>Women came out of their houses participated in struggles and even went to prisons. Now-a-days men and women are equally valued.</p>

				<h2>4. Quality Education</h2>
				<p>Education was something not equally given to every section of society in a way it should be given during Colonial period.</p>
				<p>Gandhiji used to visit many schools and taught the students the meaning of swaraj and encouraged them to work for their country</p>
				<p>Now education is being given in an open and fair manner, free to children upto age an of 14 years.</p>

				<h2>3. Good Health and Well Being</h2>
				<p>In the days of 1900s diseases like Polio had no treatment and people with this often die.</p>
				<p>Gandhiji wanted to make India a healthy India where no one will die of not being treated well.</p>
				<p>In today's world campaigns against Polio, Measels, Rubella, etc. are being conducted to provide free vaccination so that it may not cause an epidemic or plague.</p>

				<h2>2.Zero Hunger</h2>
				<p>Hunger was something India suffered a lot from due to poverty and discrimination in the days of 1900s, a person who is poor or is of a very low caste suffered from hunger.</p>
				<p>Gandhiji used to skip his one time meal so that it may be saved for the one who is poor and hungry</p>
				<p>Now-a-days we see mid-day meals, Bhoj Banks and also government provided subsidy on food grains.</p>

				<h2>1. No Poverty</h2>
				<p>Gandhiji wanted to make India free from poverty caused by the centuries of being looted by Britishers.</p>
				<p>Poverty was one of Gandhiji's main steps to reform society.</p>
				<p>Still this agenda can be executed in present time. We see facilities provided to BPLs and concessions based on income etc.</p>
