		<li>Quality Education</li>
		<li>Gender Equality</li>
		<li>Clean Water and Sanitation</li>
		<li>Affordable and Clean Energy</li>
		<li>Reduced Inequalities</li>
		<li>Sustainable Cities and Communities</li>
		<li>Responsible Consumption and Production</li>
		<li>Peace, Justice and strong Institutions</li>
		<li>Partnerships for the Goals</li>
	</ol>
	<ul>
		<li>Each heading first has the historical cause of the goal to be needed for.</li>
		<li>Then it has the Gandhian ideology on that referrence and his point of view or solution on that.</li>
		<li>Then it has the modern day application of it i.e. where it is being used or regulated or where it is need and how can one implement it.</li>
	</ul>

<p>I hope my project will be a good peice of creativity and representation.</p>
